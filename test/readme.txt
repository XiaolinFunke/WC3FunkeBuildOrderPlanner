#To run all unit tests, do (from main directory):
#py -m unittest
#To run some subset of the tests that match a string, do:
#py -m unittest -k stringToMatch
#For example, if you want to run just the method "testRunningTwice", you could do
#py -m unittest -k testRunningTwice
#Or, if you wanted to run all methods for Elf, you could do
#py -m unittest -k testElf*
